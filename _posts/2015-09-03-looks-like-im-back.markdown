Once again, I delayed like a ton on bring you guys some more content on this amazingly designed blog. I seriously have to compensate for that.

It's been almost seven months ever since the last entry, and I have to say a majority of aspects changed around me in the meantime. Nothing to worry though, I have returned to the world of blogging, and will try to keep you people posted. I can only say you guys need to expect weekly content, I will most likely start posting on Fridays from now on. That's why the announcement is on a Thursday. See? Easy peasy.

Stay tunned for some updates, I will bring them over! Promise. Seriously. No joking.

Nel is over and out, returning 0!
