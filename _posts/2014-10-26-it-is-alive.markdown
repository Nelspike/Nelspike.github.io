Hello fellow followers! I am proud to announce that, as of the 26th October of the year 2014, I have just completed my blog construction! Exciting, isn't it?

The objective of this blog is pretty simple. I'll be posting about the most various issues on programming, software engineering, development, games, and not to forget coding in general. I decided to build this blog to share small tips on certain programming aspects, since most of us developers end up *googling* for answers on the most diverse things. Worry not, I'll try to help you the best way I can.

Over and out, returning 0!
