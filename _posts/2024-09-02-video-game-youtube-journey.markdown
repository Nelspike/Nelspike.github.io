It's been over 8 years since I've posted here, it seems... Wow. I can't believe time flew by that quick. It's time I go on a brand new journey!

I could go on and on about what happened in the last years, but I will leave that for another post if I'm ever feeling inspired - There's really tons to catch up on, believe you me. But that's not why I'm here today, today I'm here to talk about starting something I never thought I would have the guts to start: [A YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Nelspike)! ðŸ“¼

Yes, you read it right. YouTube. That thing that a lot of people use for entertainment, information, among other purposes, but never really get down to creating videos. I've decided to try my luck with it.

## But Nel, what will you actually do with your channel?

Putting it simply, I'll just post videos of me playing video games. That's it! Or well... Maybe a small twist: I'll post videos of me playing _retro_ video games! The definition of what a retro game is is pretty subjective, so I'll try to narrow it down, or at least, to what I will consider a retro game for the channel: *Anything that's 20 or more years old*. And I won't look at genre either, just post videos!

## Wait... Why?

A better question would be: "why not"? Nah, just kidding. I've recently been to Japan _twice_ in the last two years, and seeing how there were dedicated stores to retro gaming, retro arcades and a general love and care for all things electronic, it made me think twice about a couple of things:

- What kinds of things do I like doing in my free time?
- What exactly are my hobbies, do I have anything I feel this passionate about?
- I've been talking about playing and cherishing retro games, why haven't I done anything in that regard?
- What's stopping me from just... Doing it?

And with that, I suddenly had a lot of other questions and answers, things just buzzing through my mind. I do love programming, coding and whatnot, but it's been way too long I have dedicated time for myself, my other passions and living my life. So why not just try things?

## That's beautiful and all, shows the channel!

Thought you'd never ask! I already linked it above in case you weren't paying attention, but here it is:

I've already posted three videos ever since, where I played the Mega Drive version of the first [Puyo Puyo](https://youtu.be/iMRnSc3rw0c) split in two parts, as well as Super Famicom's very own [Soul Blader](https://youtu.be/rgX9k28z5I8) with its very first part out. Super pumped to get even more content out! Check my latest video as of today:

</div>

And to conclude, I just want to say a couple of things:

- I'll try my best to keep the common YouTube phrases such as "Like and Subscribe!" or "Please like the content of our channel, it helps us a lot!". Not because I'm not looking for those, but I want to keep the videos as lean as possible and just focus on what I'm doing.
- The channel's language is English, but first and foremost, I am Portuguese. I expect one or two videos down the line to be in Portuguese, especially if I'm playing games with other people (I have some ideas)!
- And lastly, I want people to have fun!

So yeah, please give me channel a look, and while I will not ask people to subscribe _during_ a video, I will do so here on this blog post: If you've come this far, do subscribe and give my videos a watch once in a while, even if in the background! I want to share these moments with all of you!

And with all of that said, I will retire for the day. A very long blog post about what happened over the last 8 years is more than warranted, and while I mentioned in this blog that I'd try to keep coming back every week with news, I won't say it this time around. Whenever I find the time and space for it, I will post something. Keep an ear out!

Nel is over and out, returning 0!
