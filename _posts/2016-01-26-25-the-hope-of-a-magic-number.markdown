Yeah, so it seems. I’ve hit the age of 25. Quarter of a century. The fourth of a hundred. Twenty plus five.

Apart from being one year older, I have learned a great deal. People usually say that you get another glimpse at life as you get older, and I can’t be indifferent to it. With that, I bring you some news!

- I _finally_ started developing [__Icy Fire__](http://nelspike.github.io/games/2014/11/18/icy-fire.html). Hooray! Some news coming up soon!
- In between, I have also gotten back to think about my [personal page](https://github.com/Nelspike/Webfolio). It's a bit deserted, but I'll tackle it soon enough. I wanted to create a page for self-promotion, and with that, a portfolio with all the games I developed.
- Life in Böblingen is starting to pay off, since now I have control over my schedule and free time. Waking up early is an amazing boost in confidence, and a time saver.
- With working from home for all my projects, I’ve gained a bunch of experience and insight on how it is to work independently. More news coming up soon!
- I’ve been reading [Game Programming Patterns](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0990582906), by Robert Nystrom. Let me tell you, quite the book! A lot of stuff I knew already, but others that are giving me great insights on the craft I want to follow.

Now, as you may know, I left out a promise of creating a blog post every Friday, but have been a bit... Out of it. It’s time to wage in that promise.

I left 2015 behind, and with it, my 24-year-old self. Laziness is not allowed in anymore! Stay tuned!

Nel is over and out, returning 0!
