Hiatuses can be sweet, but they can also be.. "sweet". I'm not really sure what to say about this one in particular. Maybe <i>bittersweet</i>. Maybe <i>amazing</i>. I have no damn clue.

However, it's good to note that I am back. But what the hell happened all this time? It's simple. Life got to me, and as usual, when life gets in the way, you have to solve things. Also laziness! Onwards though. Had a couple of changes recently, and the biggest one was I moved towns in Germany. Yes, I left Berlin, the city that received me so well in its culture, to move down to Stuttgart. I cannot express enough gratitude for all the experiences I went through in the <i>Hauptstadt</i>, and for all the people and the exceedingly great friends I made there. You guys know who you are. You know who I'm pointing at. I left Portugal and my hometown in Espinho to pursue the start of a long career I tend to be developing. Not only for the career, but also for my dearest one. Regardless, moving to Berlin was the start of that very same adventure I set out myself to back in July of 2014. A lot happened in the 10 months I was there, and one of them was starting this blog. You guys deserve a share of the things I went through. So here goes!

I moved into a small room in Berlin back in July, and stayed there for a whole 8 months. It was quite the stay, my room mate was a nice person, and I had quite the good time. Except when I moved out. It was quite dramatic, but things kind of sorted themselves out. I then moved out to another place, which took me in for 2 months. In those 2 months, I lived alone (pretty much only had my room mate around for 3-4 days a month), with the company of the amazing kitties Otto and Yoda (I miss you guys!). Work-wise, I stayed over at [Rivalfox](http://rivalfox.com), where I developed most of the professional skills I possess to this day. A <b>HUGE</b> thank you to the guys that taught me what being a professional is all about!

Then, by the end of June of 2015, my ride over at Rivalfox came to an end. I had been offered a position in Stuttgart, down at [n-fuse](http://n-fuse.de), starting off in August 2015. I decided it would be a good idea to follow the ambition of moving to the south of the country and closer to my girlfriend, and to also pursue some of my objectives of trying to integrate the gaming industry - something I have been thoroughly working on. So far, things have been quite smooth at n-fuse. Just the normal first two months of getting used to a new company and to new technologies, situations and environment. What did I do in July, you guys might ask? Easy. I went down to Portugal for two weeks, spent some quality time at home with my family, reviewed friends, and for the rest of the month.. Hunting for a house. Yeah, that's about it. Hunting for houses in Germany is quite the pain, but I will leave that for another post.

So right now, I am living in a WG (terminology used for a shared apartment in Germany) with 3 more room mates, until I get to my new place in October. By then, I will have a place for myself and my girlfriend, since we'll both move in together! I'm quite excited for that, since it's going to be the first time I'm going to move in with someone together, and start something for real. And to have a better internet connection, the one at my current place is a pain in the... to handle.

So why am I posting this late? Work caught up with me today, and spent almost 3 hours on a regional train to get down to my girlfriend's place, in the beautiful region of Konstanz. I'll be spending the weekend around, and regaining some energy, since I am extremely tired. I just wanted to keep my promise to you people. Seriously. And I meant it for real!

I'll catch up on all the other matters sometime in the next days, and of course, more stuff to come on my weekly post next Friday! Keep an eye, and stick around, guys.

Nel is over and out, returning 0!
